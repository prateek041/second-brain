Hey! Prateek here. This is a new step I am taking; it is about telling my story to the world. That includes the awesome things I build, every day. specifically, what I learn through them, and maybe, what you can learn from them.

This article is about building Senseii, a product that I wish I always had. I have started building it few months ago and here is the journey about it and me.

I am a Software Engineer from India, who is graduating from college in two months. See, I haven't mentioned the name of college? because it is not a big one, but my dreams make up for it (they are big :D). I have always wanted to impact humans around me, to do something that changed their lives in a positive way. And that is what Senseii is all about.

There are two major things lacking, respect for health and fitness, along with the ability to believe that students from small colleges can do something about it. I want to provide health literacy to a wide variety of people, specifically who are not willing to pay big bucks to professionals along with becoming a living example to people from my background, that we can make impact on the world. so, I started with this Idea.

The Idea

Senseii, which in Japanese stands for a teacher is a personalized AI product, that helps people achieve their Goals while teaching them. Now that is a broad statement, right? let's get deeper. Everyone has goals, these goals can be broadly categorized in three major groups, Health, Work and Relationships. That includes "I want to be in a better shape", "I want to eat healthy", "I want to learn this specific skill" all the way to "I want to better communicate my feelings". Achieving a goal is a three step process.

Understand the Goals better: we don't really know what we want in the first go, it is often layered.
